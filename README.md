# Covid19-vs-Flu-hypothesis

Experts say there are a number of reasons why COVID-19 is a more serious illness than the
seasonal flu. They point out there’s no vaccine yet for COVID-19 and community-wide immunity
hasn’t built up. COVID-19 is also more infectious than the flu and has a higher death
rate. COVID-19 also has a higher rate of hospitalizations. In this project herein, we will focus
on comparing the death rate of Covid-19 and the Influenza on focus on rejecting the null
hypothesis that the Covid-19 is just like any common flu. We will do this by the following:
Part 1: Collection of the Dataset - Data is the backbone of any sound decision making. In this
part, we will focus on the data sources.
Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize
their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not,
but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or
hypothesis testing task.
Part 3: Hypothesis Testing - In theory, methods, and practice of testing a hypothesis by
comparing it with the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is only rejected if its probability falls
below a predetermined significance level, in which case the hypothesis being tested is said to
have that level of significance. In our case our Hypothesis Testing case would be:
Null Hypothesis (H0): Covid19 is not any more dangerous than the normal flu (We will compare
the death counts) Covid19 = Influenza
Alternate Hypothesis (Ha): Covid19 is more dangerous that the common influenza
Significance Level (a) = 0.05
We will calculate the test statistic and corresponding P-Value
Based on the results of our testing, we will form our conclusion and recommendations herein
below.
